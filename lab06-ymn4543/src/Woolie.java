     * isn't running, it means another Woolie has fallen and they must exit
     * and re-enter the course.  If the course is running, they must attempt

     * closer to completing the course.  Otherwise, they have fallen into the
     * river.  Once they reach the shore (automatically happens) they must
     * return to the end of the line and return their preserver to the Kraken.
